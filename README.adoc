= Fabric8 Gateway

== Overview

The fabric8-gateway is a PoC to see how we can automate Gateway API publishing for a bunch of API in services marked with annotation/labels.

- inspired by (link:https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-controller[K8s Sample Controller])
- following (link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/controllers.md[Best Pactices])

For the Gateway API, the integration is done with link:https://github.com/3scale[3scale].

This is very much a work in progress. Therefore a link:TODO.md[TODO list].
